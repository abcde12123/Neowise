# Neowise
A simple two-player game

**NEOWISE is a high-speed hybrid of Tetris and platformer survival built in UE5. You must manage two tasks at once: clearing blocks to stay alive and moving your character to avoid being crushed. The game supports two-player co-op, where one player controls the character while the other manages the blocks.**

NEOWISE 是一款基于 UE5 开发的、结合了俄罗斯方块与平台生存的高节奏游戏 。玩家需要同时处理两项任务：通过消除方块来维持生存，同时移动角色以防被方块砸中 。游戏支持双人合作模式，由一人控制角色移动，另一人负责控制方块下落 。
