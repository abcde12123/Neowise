# Neowise
A simple two-player game
**NEOWISE is a high-speed hybrid of Tetris and platformer survival built in UE5. You must manage two tasks at once: clearing blocks to stay alive and moving your character to avoid being crushed. The game supports two-player co-op, where one player controls the character while the other manages the blocks.**
